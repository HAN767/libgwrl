-need to make sure the time input source is expired in gwrl_del_persistent_timeouts.
-possibly change proactor api's to use gwrlsrc for public functions.
-change proactor read functions to use buffer size not an actual gwprbuf

-breakup gwpr_synchronous_write - it's too big to test easily

-gwrl_free might be able to use double pointers too
-gwrl_del_persistent_timeouts can use pointer to pointer like I did in gwrl_src_del
-gwpr_free on Windows
-valgrind, callgrind
